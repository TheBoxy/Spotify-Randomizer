Uses Spotipy python library and Secrets module. 

**Description:**
Randomizes your public spotify playists using secrets' cryptography functions. I belive spotify's shuffle playist doesn't truly randomize your playist so I made this. In order to use you need to create an app in https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications and its a good idea to give it full permissions. Then plug the apps CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI into lines 6, 7, 8. (SideNote: you have to have music playing already in spotify so it adds songs to the queue and your playist has to be public.)
